                    <p class="lead mb-5"><span>The University of Virginia Cyber Competition is a new kind of collegiate defense competition sponsored by UVA designed to simulate a real-world insider threat. All scoring has been categorized as an internal and external need, while many other commonly-scored elements have been left behind. In addition, this competition features novel mechanics such as a pre-competition setup and security phase for blue teamers. Finally, the infrastructure differs from traditional setups to lessen the interaction between blue teams and out-of-scope components such as scoring bots or inject portals.<br>&nbsp;</span></p><a class="btn btn-xl js-scroll-trigger" role="button" id="signup" href="#services">Signup</a>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p class="lead mb-5" style="color: white;">Competitors will compete as consultants to the major weapons manufacturer <strong>Hyperion. </strong>Recently, Hyperion has had their manufacturing bases attacked by <strong>Maliwan.&nbsp; </strong>Hyperion has deployed their own forces to counter attack, and it is the competitors job to run the <strong>Troop-Management Network (TMN).</strong>&nbsp;The TMN is used to plan counter attacks, design new weapon systems, and complete other important tasks needed by Hyperion. As a consequence, the TMN must remain secure and functional at all times.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Competitors will be given access to the TMN four days in the week preceding the competition. During this time, competitors will be responsible for completing the TMN and securing the network. A higher level outsider at Hyperion is a <strong>double agent</strong> and will let Maliwan into the network a day before the competition. Competitors will be called back to<strong> remove Maliwan from the network</strong> during the competition.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Throughout the competition, competitors must ensure that the <strong>Intel Center</strong> on the&nbsp;Hyperion network can receive troop updates.&nbsp;This is an automated system sending in updates, and if the server goes down, the Hyperion automated system <strong>may not notice.</strong></p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Based on intel reports, Hyperion will send ground troop orders through the <strong>Troop Coordination Server (TCS)</strong>. Beyond the TCS, the Hyperion <strong>ground troops have no way to contact the TMN directly</strong>, except through Hyperion command. This means that if the TCS becomes unavailable, it may be a while for Hyperion command to inform competitors.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">The TMN will constantly be in use. Hyperion employees&nbsp;will be working on workstations dedicated to them on the <strong>TMN LAN</strong>. The work they do is mission critical; kicking them off even for a few minutes will <strong>come at a cost</strong>. As they work, every fifteen minutes, one of them (selected at random) will work on next-generation weaponry. If <strong>Maliwan obtains this information</strong>, they will gain an advantage.</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Some of the Hyperion employees on the TMN LAN are very high-level, and will <strong>need competitors help during the competition</strong>: risk assessments, vulnerability reports, status updates etc. These requests will come through the company <strong>email server</strong>, which competitors are responsible for maintaining.&nbsp;If the email server is unavailable, the employees may ask competitors directly, but having to get up from their seats will upset them; <strong>points will be deducted</strong> in this case.</p>
